This repo contains code to sort out tag sequences from fastq
files. The data that is tested comes from eDNA amplicon data sequenced
on a MiSeq with version 2 chemistry. The protocol used are using a
dual tagging systems. This means that both there are tags both prior
and after the sequence barcode that determine the origin of the
sample.

Many of the most common tools to sort by tags are not designed with
such a tag system in mind. In addition project for testing suffered
from multi-index-tag ligation which means that there sometimes were
more than one tag attached to the fragment. In such cases the tag
closest to the actual barcode should be used for analysis.
